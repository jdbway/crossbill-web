        Give skipped duplicates the xpoints and position their stored row lacks.

        Highlights uploaded before the e-reader sent xpoints are stored without
        them, and so cannot be placed in the book. A later upload carries the
        xpoints, but deduplication drops it whole, leaving the stored row
        unplaceable forever. Only the gap is filled: xpoints already stored
        stay, because the e-reader may re-anchor a highlight the reader never
        moved. The position comes with the incoming xpoints, already resolved
        against this book's EPUB, and stays NULL when there is no EPUB to
        resolve against. Soft-deleted highlights are absent from the stored
        rows and thus left untouched.

        Args:
            duplicates: Highlights skipped by deduplication
            stored: The live highlights those duplicates matched
            book_id: Book the upload belongs to

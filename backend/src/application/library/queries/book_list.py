"""Read model for the two book-list views.

These are view DTOs, not domain entities: they exist to be rendered and must
never be fed back into a command. See ``docs/adr/0001-read-models-and-query-services.md``.

The library list and the recently-viewed list render the same response schema,
so they share one DTO and one port with a method each.

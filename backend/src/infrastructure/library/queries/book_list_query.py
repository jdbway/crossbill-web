"""Query adapter for the two book-list views.

Rows map straight to view DTOs. The old path came out of the repository as
``list[tuple[Book, int, int]]``: every row was hydrated into a ``Book``
aggregate -- value objects, invariant checks and all -- so that a list could
render a dozen columns. Queries select, join, filter, order and group; they
never decide anything.

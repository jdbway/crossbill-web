## Usage

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crossbill": {
      "command": "crossbill-mcp",
      "env": {
        "CROSSBILL_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
        "CROSSBILL_EMAIL": "your-email",
        "CROSSBILL_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

Add to your Claude Code MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crossbill": {
      "command": "crossbill-mcp",
      "env": {
        "CROSSBILL_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
        "CROSSBILL_EMAIL": "your-email",
        "CROSSBILL_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Can also be added by command:

```
claude mcp add crossbill -e CROSSBILL_URL=http://localhost:8000 -e CROSSBILL_EMAIL=user@example.com -e CROSSBILL_PASSWORD='password' -- crossbill-mcp
```

### Direct

```bash
export CROSSBILL_URL=http://localhost:8000
export CROSSBILL_EMAIL=your-email
export CROSSBILL_PASSWORD=your-password
crossbill-mcp
```

## Deleting data

Two tools throw content away rather than change it:

- **delete_book** - Delete a book with all its chapters and highlights. A hard delete: syncing the book from KOReader again recreates it, but the notes, flashcards, tags and digests Crossbill kept alongside it are gone
- **delete_highlights** - Delete highlights from a book. The deletion sticks, so later syncs of that book will not bring them back

Neither one deletes anything on the assistant's say-so. Before touching the API, the server asks you to confirm through MCP elicitation, spelling out what is about to go: the book's title and how many chapters and highlights it holds, or how many highlights and from which book. Only an explicit yes goes through; declining or dismissing the prompt leaves everything in place.

The prompt comes from the server, not from the assistant, so it cannot be talked around. If your MCP client does not support elicitation, the deletion is refused outright and you are pointed at the Crossbill web UI instead — a client that cannot ask you is a client that cannot delete.

Every deletion tool in the server (these two plus `delete_note`, `delete_flashcard`, `delete_tag`, `delete_tag_group` and `delete_bookmark`) is annotated `destructiveHint: true`, which clients can use to treat them differently from the rest. If you allowlist the whole Crossbill server in Claude Code, keep the delete tools behind a prompt:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "ask": ["mcp__crossbill__delete_*"]
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

### Books

- **list_books** - List books with optional search and pagination
- **get_book** - Get detailed book info with chapters and highlights
- **get_recently_viewed_books** - Get recently viewed books
- **set_reading_stage** - Set a book's manual reading stage (`to_read`, `skimming`, `reading`, `finished`, `reflected`, `did_not_finish`), or clear it so the book has no stage
- **delete_book** - Delete a book with all its chapters and highlights, after asking you to confirm (see [Deleting data](#deleting-data))

### Highlights

- **get_highlights** - Get highlights from a book, optionally filtered by search
- **update_highlight_note** - Add or update a note on a highlight, or clear it by omitting the note
- **tag_highlight** - Add a tag to a highlight
- **untag_highlight** - Remove a tag from a highlight
- **delete_highlights** - Delete one or more highlights from a book, after asking you to confirm (see [Deleting data](#deleting-data))

### Highlight Labels

- **get_book_highlight_labels** - Get all highlight labels for a book with resolved labels and counts
- **get_global_highlight_labels** - Get all global default highlight labels
- **update_highlight_label** - Update label text and/or UI color on a highlight style
- **create_global_highlight_label** - Create a new global default highlight label

### Flashcards

- **get_flashcards** - Get all flashcards for a book
- **create_flashcard** - Create a flashcard, optionally anchored to a `highlight_id`, `note_id`, or `chapter_id` (give at most one)
- **update_flashcard** - Update a flashcard's question and/or answer
- **delete_flashcard** - Delete a flashcard

The three suggestion tools below require an AI provider configured on the Crossbill server; without one they report that AI features are not enabled. They only suggest question/answer pairs — nothing is saved until you pass one to `create_flashcard`.

- **suggest_flashcards_for_chapter** - Suggest flashcards from a chapter's digest (the chapter must already have one)
- **suggest_flashcards_for_highlight** - Suggest flashcards from a highlight's text
- **suggest_flashcards_for_note** - Suggest flashcards from a note and its linked highlights

### Reading

- **get_reading_sessions** - Get reading sessions for a book, with `limit` and `offset` for paging
- **get_chapter_content** - Get full text content of a chapter from the EPUB
- **get_reading_session_summary** - Get an AI summary of what was read in one session, cached after the first call. Requires an AI provider configured on the Crossbill server

### Chapter Digests

A digest is an AI-written study aid for one chapter: a summary, a list of keypoints, and comprehension questions with answers. Generating one requires an AI provider configured on the Crossbill server; without one, `generate_chapter_digest` and `generate_book_digests` report that AI features are not enabled.

- **get_chapter_digest** - Get a chapter's existing digest, or a note that it has none yet
- **generate_chapter_digest** - Generate one chapter's digest synchronously; this makes an AI call and can take tens of seconds
- **answer_digest_question** - Record the user's answer to one question, by its zero-based index into the digest's questions
- **get_book_digests** - Get every chapter digest a book has
- **generate_book_digests** - Enqueue digest generation for all of a book's chapters as a background job batch
- **get_digest_generation_status** - Get the active digest batch for a book, for polling progress
- **get_job_batch** - Get any job batch by ID, with its status and progress counts
- **cancel_job_batch** - Cancel a job batch and abort the jobs in it that have not run yet

### Bookmarks

- **list_bookmarks** - Get every bookmark in a book
- **create_bookmark** - Bookmark a highlight
- **delete_bookmark** - Delete a bookmark

### Semantic Search

Requires an embedding provider configured on the Crossbill server; without one, both tools report that semantic search is not enabled.

- **semantic_search** - Rank highlights, notes, and chapter digests by semantic similarity to a natural-language query, optionally scoped to one book. Results are grouped by content type, with `limit` applied per group.
- **find_related** - Find content similar to an existing item, named by `content_type` (`note`, `highlight`, or `digest`) and `content_id`. Same grouped response shape as `semantic_search`.

### Notes

Notes are markdown documents that belong to a book and can be linked to that book's chapters and highlights, and to tags. A note may carry an optional `kind`: `character`, `term`, `concept`, `gist`, `reflection`, or `other`.

- **create_note** - Create a note in a book from a title and markdown body, optionally with a kind and links to chapters, highlights, and tags
- **get_note** - Get one note with its linked chapters, highlights, tags, and flashcards
- **get_book_notes** - List a book's notes, optionally filtered by `kind`, `chapter_id`, `highlight_id`, or `tag_id` (filters combine)
- **update_note** - Replace a note's fields and links in full. Anything omitted is cleared, so fetch the note with `get_note` first and resend everything you want to keep
- **delete_note** - Delete a note and its links

### Tags

Tags belong to one book and can be attached to that book's highlights and notes. A tag group is an optional folder gathering related tags; a tag outside every group has a null `tag_group_id`.

- **get_book_tags** - Get every tag of a book, with the group each one belongs to
- **create_tag** - Create a tag in a book (to tag a highlight, use `tag_highlight`, which creates the tag by name when needed)
- **update_tag** - Rename a tag and/or move it into a tag group
- **delete_tag** - Delete a tag, which also removes it from every highlight carrying it
- **create_or_rename_tag_group** - Create a tag group, or rename an existing one by passing its `tag_group_id`
- **delete_tag_group** - Delete a tag group, leaving the tags in it ungrouped

### Reflection

A book's reflection is its answers to four fixed questions: what is it about, what does it say, do I agree, so what. An answer is not text but a reference to the note holding that answer's markdown, so answering means writing a note first and passing its ID. The reflection also links the book's term and concept notes.

- **get_book_reflection** - Get a book's reflection; every book has one, unanswered questions are null
- **update_book_reflection** - Replace a reflection in full. Anything omitted is cleared, so fetch it with `get_book_reflection` first and resend everything you want to keep

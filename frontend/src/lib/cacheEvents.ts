/**
 * Cache invalidation expressed as domain events rather than query keys.
 *
 * Mutations say what changed — `noteChanged`, `tagsChanged` — and this module
 * decides which queries that invalidates. Callers do not name query keys, so
 * the set of queries affected by a change lives in one place instead of being
 * restated, and diverging, at each mutation site.
 *
 * Keys always come from the generated getters. A hand-written key silently
 * matched nothing for months (see the books list after deleting a book), which
 * is the failure this module exists to make unrepeatable.
 *
 * Not for optimistic updates, cache seeding or write-through: those legitimately
 * reach for `setQueryData` at their call site, and describing them as events
 * would misrepresent what they do.
